# Hey, I'm Manfred ðŸ‘‹

I am a freelancer developer working on various projects. Mostly for the ROBLOX platform however I do work in other languages and frameworks as well.

I have over 4 years of experience working with multiple platforms and systems creating interactive and user friendly experiences. I code in C#, Python, JS/TS, Lua and I mainly work with React or Svelte for Front End development.
